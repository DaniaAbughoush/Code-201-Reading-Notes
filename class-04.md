 # lay out:
 CSS treat each elements in the html as seperate box in can be seprated by boards and margin:
 * block -level like **li** has its on box
 * inline box flow through text like **img**
 * **the containing element** if block level element inside another block level element then its a containing or **parent** like **div**
 **you can Controlling the Position of Elements**:
 1. **Normal flow** Every block-level element appears on a new line and this is the default will cause to lower element to go down.
 2. **Relative Positioning** will not affect the other element you can shift top,right,left.
 3. **Absolute positioning** will not affect surrounding elements will be scrolled.
 
 **box offset** to control the box position hoe far from right,top,left,bottom.
 **Fixed Positioning** will not move when scrolled up or down.
 **Floating Elements** i can move it up down
 **z-index** to control which box appear on top.
 * **normal flow**  not nedd the CSS but this is the syntax for it:**position: static**
 * **relative position** position:relative
  * **the absolute position** use this syntax **position:absolute**
  * **fixed position:** use this syntax **position:fixed**
  * **float** to place element side by side.
  * we can clera float too
  * you should take in condration the screen size and resolution and paper size when printing. 
  ** the fixed layout wont change the size in different divice.

# There are two types of list :
* order list using for it **ol** .use number
* unorderd list use for it **ul** use circles
* use **li** to put each element in the list inside
**for defention**
use 
* **dl** for defention seperated by **dt** for terms to define and **dl** for the defension. 
we can creat nested list by doing sub list.
 # boxes
 we can resize boxes by using percantage,bx,em 
 * **bx** is the most popular because it gives the most control
 * **percantage** for relative the browser size:the box size
 * **em** based on the text side inside the boa
 * we control the size by width and high
 * if the content is bigger than the box size we can use:
 * **scroll**
 * **hidden** by hide any extra content
  box has three  properties  to control the appearance: 
  1. **Border** to seperate edges from one onother
  1. **Margin** to creat gap btween borders
  1. **Padding** is the space btween borders and content

  * border width controled by :
  * thin
* medium
* thick
and by:
**to control the indivisual size**
* border-top-width
* border-right-width
* border-bottom-width
* border-left-width
 **You can specify the color of aborder using either RGB values**
* border-top-color
* border-right-color
* border-bottom-color
* border-left-color

**to control the padding**
* padding-top
* padding-right
* padding-bottom
* padding-left

 **You can specify values for each side of a box using**
* margin-top
 * margin-right
* margin-bottom
* margin-left

**The display allow you to tmake  inline element into a block-level lement or vice versa**

 **The visibility  allows you to hide or appeare theme**
 **The border-image**
  applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a background image and slices it into nine pieces.
  * it need:
  1. The URL of the image
2. Where to slice the image
3. What to do with the straight edges

**we can shadow to the boxes**
**CSS3** allow to do border-radius.
#### arrays:
An array  stores a list of values.values seperated by ; and number start with **zero** not one.
**A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. and it used for equal**
weak typing in java means that the values can change.
==and =! check only value
===and==! check value and type.

loops:
loops check condition it is true will run the block code ,and will keep checking until it retun false. There are three types of loops

for:to tell the loop how much time should check use ccondition as counter counter.
while: will keep running till give me true condition.
do while: will run the statment inside {} at least once even its fault.
loop counter ++for++ :
has three statment after variable call it i :

intilization:i=0 will act like counter
condition:i<number that will run till specific number. we can name varible here instade of number
update :i++ will add one every time condition will run it also can count down --
example on writing 5times table
first define var i=1 and var msg="" the += means add new content in the msg the while(i<10) to count nine time then add this content in the msg+= then i to start count number then fixed this expression 5= in '' then do math i5 then will write the result.

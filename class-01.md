•	In this reading you will read general and usful information about html structure and elements then abrief information about javascript
Pages include different elements such as content usually be in white background,digram in black and its written in different programming 
languge and we open these pages in different ways such as webbrowser,web server,or devices. When we enter the name of the ip address or the page 
we want we send it to to Dns which can be any place in the word then send it to web server then to web browser.html structure helds in the tags like
html tag ,head body and there are opening tag which hold attribute inside it can tell us more about the element but name and value.and we can see how
other built these web page via source.**html** had many version through time passing so the DOCTYPE use to tell us about the version of html we use.
And we can add comment only visible to developer or any one use source ,and there is a thing called **global attribute** which is the id to give an element
unique feature we use it in CSS too by referring it by **’#’** and if we we want to different a group of element and give them the same value use class attribute .
there is element called **block element** appear in new line and the **inline** will continue in the same line .**div** will allow you to contain
all element you want in one block.**span**will allow you to contain element in inline mostly used in CSS ..	ifram is like when we see Google map on
a page so it used to open a page in our page by using scr,width,heigh.scrolling is an attribute not supported in 	html5 used in ifram if the page is
bigger than the space that we allow.framboard the same not supported in html 5 and it use for board in the iframe and we use
 when the scrollbar not desired a seamless att.**meta**is an empty tag having no closing tag to contain information like expire time ,if the engine should 
 put our page on research who make this page….and if we want to add element to be shown on our page there is something called escap element we use it to
 show our element....html5 make the layout of the page easier there is element is good to use like article to contain the sections and there 
 is **aside**if its used inside the article should contin information about the article if its out side should contain information about the page.each article can
 have its own header and footer. Figer for images and diagram ,group to treat element like one block.old browser doesnot understand html5 and will treat  all element like 
 inline so we add CSS line and javascript.  design is something that i need to take in consedration . before designing a web page we should know the most important thing whish
 is *the ccoustmer* for who i design this web page , I need to know  the information i will provied for who, the lay out should be clear ,can other tell what the button i 
 provied about. information should be clear and under standable the navigator is clear,easy and understandable.
#### java script:
Java script is like instruction to achieve gaol so I need to know my goal and design first.then make steps if its hard one using flowchart then 
code each step so computer can understand and there is object  is physical things in java script which is like content and every object has property
with name and value .java script define how the object will do call that event.and how object interact is method .when compine all these together to creat
something in real world we call it model.webpage is objects and using document object can control what user see.the website see the page first as html codes
then there is adocument object and there is node then creatmodel the renger engine play codes and if there is no CSS it playdefault layout.when there is javascript
there is a script engine ”interpret”   translate codes to computer to do tasks.  The web bage written in 3 languges1.html<>for content layer,second is javascript()
for  behavior layer like hoe the page interact, and the third is Css{}for presentation layer how the html is presented.is available for every one and these three 
languge wok together for enhancement.Java script doesn’t need new tool when you need to write java script use scribt from html.  Usefull code in java script a write
object and methods : document.write(‘parameter’!); and note that when java  script come cross along html script it will run. Statement is the steps in jave
is written inside this{},this ;tells where the statement ends.* statment organized in code blocks.

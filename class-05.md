Btween bak grounfd color and text color to make it readable make high contrast but for too long reading use medium contrast.
Rgba : a called an alpha value for opacity fall btween (0-1) in old browser maybe the wont understand the rgba value so It will play solid color

# Typeface Terminology:
* **Serif**: Serif fonts have extra details onthe ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.
* **Sans-Serif**: Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.
* **Monospace**: Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)

# images
* You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.by width and height.

* Rather than using the img tag element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:
1.  The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the  image.
2.  New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

* By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text.In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.
 * two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
 1.  On the containing element,you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
 2. 2: On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

 * background-image:The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML
element.
# repeat:
The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).
 * repeat-x:The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left)
 * repeat-y:The image is repeated vertically only.
* no-repeat:The image is only shown once.


* fixed:The background image stays in the same position on the page.
* scroll:The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.


# background-position:
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.This property usually has a pair of values. The first represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical.

* Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to asecond style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it. 
* When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a sprite.You can add the logo and other interface elements, as well as buttons to the image.
* To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.


# Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
* SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website's visibility on search engines.
1. The Basics:Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
2. On-Page Techniques:On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.
3. Off-Page Techniques:Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page
techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of
other sites that link to yours.


* In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability.
1. Page Title:The page title appears at the top of the browser window or on the tab of a browser. It is specified in the **title** element which lives inside the **head** element.
2.  URL / Web Address:The name of the file is part ofthe URL. Where possible, use keywords in the file name
3. Headings:If the keywords are in a heading **hn** element then a search engine will know that this page is all about that subject and give it greater weight than other text.
4. Text:Where possible, it helps torepeat the keywords in the main body of the text at least 2-3 times. Do not, however, over-use these terms, because the text must be
5. Link Text:Use keywords in the text that create links between pages (rather than using generic expressions such as "click here").
6. Image Alt Text:Search engines rely on you providing accurate descriptions of images in the alt text. This will also help your images show up in the results of image-based searches.
7. Page Descriptions :The description also lives inside the **head** element and is specified using a **meta**tag.It should be a sentence that describes the content of the page. (These are not shown in the browser window but they may be displayed in the results pages of search engines.)

# Determining which keywords to use on your site:
 can be one of the hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.

1. Brainstorm:List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics,products or services your site is about.
2.  Organize:Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website
3.  Research:There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider
4. Compare:It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every keyword. This is especially true for topics where there is a lot of competition. The more sites out there that have already been optimized for a given keyword, the harder it will be for you to rise up the search results when people search on that term.
5. Refine:Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on.These should always be the ones
that are most relevant to each section of your site.
6.  Map:Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which have the most competition, and which ones are most relevant,it is time to start picking which
keywords you will use for each page.


* As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics

1. Signing Up:The Google Analytics service relies on you signing up for an account at:
www.google.com/analytics The site will give you a piece of tracking code which you need to
put on every page of your site.
2. How it Works:Every time someone loads a page of your site, the tracking code sends data to the Google servers where it is stored.Google then provides a webbased interface that allows you
to see how visitors use your site.
3. The Tracking Code:A tracking code is provided by Google Analytics for each website you are tracking. It should appear just before the closing head tag. The code does not alter the appearance of your web pages.

# Domain Names & Hosting
1. DOMAIN NAMES Your domain name is your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc.co.uk). There are many websites that allow you to register domain names. Usually you will have to pay an annual fee to keep that domain name.
2. web hoisting:So that other people can see your site, you will need to upload it to a web server. Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set up to serve web page

* FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
* Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).

# Flash, Video & Audio:
Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later
for playing audio and video in websites.

* If you want to create your own Flash movie, you need to purchase the Flash authoring
environment from Adobe.

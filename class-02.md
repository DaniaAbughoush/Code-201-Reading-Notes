Statement is the steps in jave is written inside this{},this ;tells where the statement ends.* statment organized in code blocks, when you need to write multi line comment use /* and end it with /* < if single line comments use //. variable use to store data written like this: Var quantity; then quantity=some value, Java separate betwwe number like 1,2,3 or strings like word or boolena (true,false).and we can use variable to store these three,to add quotes use “”then put quotes inside. For example if you want to store cost=revenue + profite define var profit,then variable revenue then give each a value then define val cost to revenue and profit in java script way..
and there is arule to write name 
* it should start with$or- but dont use -or$ in variable names
* do not use the key word for naming.
* use name to describe varibles clearly.
* **arrays** store multiple values seprated by   , and we can acces it and change it.
* Expretions : there is two type of expretion :first the one which have variable using single value like variable have value of color or expretion with two value like area =5 * 6 (two valueis 5 and 6) and thats calledoperator, java script has mathmatical operation like *-+/, concatenation: is using strings to creat one value and there is only one string:the+symbol(example:var college= ltuc var course=programming var your special=college+course)

we should make **desicion making** using flow chart.
there is 2 component of decsion making 1.evaluating2.aconditional statment
 * Evaluting 
  : we call checking or testing condition evaluting, mostly for boolen data.

 **comarision operator:**
* a==b if a equal b in value
* a!=b if a does not equal b in value
* a===b if a  strict equal b in value and type
* a!== if a strict not equal b in value and type
* a < b if a less than b
* a < b if a less or equal b
* a > b if a greater than b
* a ++ b if a greater or equal b
* **logical operator** 
* && logical and will give true if every side is true
+ || logical or will give true if one side is true
- ! not reverse the value
* the if statment if condition true run the statment. there is if else if condtion true run statment if wrong run the next statment.
